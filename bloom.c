    DESCRIPTION:
    A Bloom Filter (BF) is a method of encoding a variable length piece of
    input data to a fixed length signature.  The basic idea is to map
    attributes of the data to specific positions in a binary vector.  First,
    the result vector is initialized to all 0's.  Next, a series of hash
    functions are applied to the data to map some part of the input data
    to a position in the result vector.  Thus, if a is the input data,
    and m is length of the result vector, then hash(a) produces a value in the
    range 0...m-1.

    A similar method encoding data into a fixed length result vector can be
    accomplished using a crytographic digest.  A digest function like MD5
    is designed such that the difference between any two digests does not in
    any way correlate to similar differences in input messages.  This is
    an important property in certain applications however it may also be
    desirable that the difference between digests corresponds to
    differences in the input messages.  Because a bloom filter is derived from
    attributes of the input message, the difference between any two Bloom
    Filter digests corresponds to differences in the input data.

    IMPLEMENTATION:
    This bloom filter implementation is meant take any byte sequence as input
    so a generic hash function is used.  The input stream is divided into
    chunks and hashed using a 32 bit adler modulo m.  In order to get the most
    complete coverage, the chunk N+1 includes all but one of the bytes in
    chunk N and one byte not included in chunk N.  (i.e. the chunk window
    slides to right one byte per hash)

    The difference between any two bloom filter digests is computed by taking
    the logical and of the two digests and computing the number of bit of
    similarity.  The similar count is then divided by maximum of the total
    number of bit in either digest.  This acts to normalize the bit count for
    large and small signatures.  The similarity is then turned into a distance
    by take 1 - normalized bit count.
